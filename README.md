This is real estate project I have created for POC to integrate the Contactstack with NextJS.
This project covers most of the fields provided in Contactstack and tried to integrate that with the frontend.

## Tech Stack
- Contactstack Headless CMS (Backend)
- NextJS - 13.1.2 (Frontend)
- Bootstrap - 5.2 (UI)

## About Contenstack

Contentstack is a headless CMS that touts itself a platform that can build the best digital experience for web, mobile, IoT, AR and VR." It was crafted by Built.io, the vendor behind an API-first enterprise suite of products including Flow, a Platform-as-a-Service, Backend, a Mobile-Backend-as-a-Service, and Contentstack, the headless CMS

For more information you can read the [contenstack documentation](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/)


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
## NextJS


Open [http://localhost:3010](http://localhost:3010) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
